(Academic Staff Association of Wits University) ASAWU noted the resignation of the Vice Chancellor and Principal, Prof Adam Habib, with effect from the end of this year. The Vice Chancellor has served Wits for 7 years under difficult times including #feesmustfall, and economic and political crises. We are aware that student enrolments, graduates, and research output have all increased during his tenure, primarily due to the tireless and selfless endeavours of ASAWU members and our academic, professional and administrative staff colleagues. We note that during the same period: While racial diversity of employees has increased during this period, we hope that the new Vice Chancellor makes progress on other dimensions of transformation, including institutional culture, employees living with disabilities, nepotism, gender based discrimination and violence, mental and emotional wellbeing, bullying, victimisation, employee morale, social justice, consistency of University policies, and reasonableness of workloads, while maintaining or improving our standing as a leading research intensive university. Although Prof Habib has insisted that during the remainder of his tenure he will not be a lame duck Vice Chancellor, we are concerned that transitional arrangements in the entire Senior Executive Team may create uncertainty and impede the building of trust between Organised Labour and the University.
