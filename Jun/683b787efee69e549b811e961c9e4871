In marking Youth Day, and six years since the launch of The Daily Vox, The Daily Vox hosted a discussion on one of the emerging struggles for equality and inclusion in higher education: the panel looked at how students are experiencing the shift to remote learning in the era of COVID-19 campus shutdowns, and what needs to happen next. The panel included Khadija Patel, co-founder of The Daily Vox, Pearl Pillat, managing director of Youth Lab, Dr Ramneek Ahluwalia CEO of Higher Health, and Fatima Moosa, journalist at The Daily Vox.
