Thato Moagi, the first South African to receive the Nuffield Agricultural Scholarship talks about being a farmer and the managing director of the Legae La Banareng farm. My parents always encouraged us to explore and be worldly people. I believe it is through them that I had opportunities to travel this country and see different landscapes and learn to appreciate nature. By being exposed and well travelled I realised that I didn’t see many young people of colour into agriculture and science. This led me to investigate what are the possibilities and inspired me to study a BSc. I didn’t realise how privileged I was until I won my first farming accolade as young farmer of the year in Limpopo in 2015. Many young people would try to get a hold of me to share my experiences and it made me realise how many people do not have access to land and capital. It was hard work and things didn’t land on my lap. Just getting to the point where my father acquired the land was difficult. We had tried many times to apply for land from government schemes but failed. I had to leave home and work on other people’s farms to gain knowledge, confidence and experience. It was a period of sacrifice – leaving the comfort of urban life and fully immersing oneself in the rural environment. I have faced many challenges in agriculture. From dealing with drought and finding ways to be productive in a changing climate. I faced challenges entering the commercial market which is a system which is not designed for new entrants. I have faced sexism, racism and ageism. However I believe each challenge is what defines you as an individual. The moments I faced challenges I decided to look at them as a way to learn new ways of doing things and new ways to communicate with people. It fuelled me to be active in leadership to ensure that the voices I represent matter and can be heard. Moagi’s words have been edited for clarity and brevity.
